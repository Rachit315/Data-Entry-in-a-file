**Data Entry with Python: A Guide to Efficient File Management**

This project demonstrates how to perform data entry from a Python program into a specific file. It's an excellent way to learn about file I/O operations and the use of conditional statements in Python. 

### **Features:**

1. **File I/O Operations:**
   - **Reading Files:** Learn how to read data from files, allowing your program to access and manipulate existing information.
   - **Writing Files:** Discover how to write data to files, enabling your program to save new information or update existing records.
   - **Appending Files:** Understand how to add data to the end of a file without overwriting the existing content.

2. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Implement logic to handle different scenarios during data entry.
   - Ensure data integrity by validating inputs before writing to the file.
   - Provide feedback to users based on their actions (e.g., success or error messages).
